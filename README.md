# Posterior Meta-Replay for Continual Learning

In this study we propose posterior-replay continual learning, a framework for continually learning task-specific posterior approximations within a single shared meta-model. Across a range of experiments, we compare this approach to prior-focused CL, for which a single trade-off solution across all tasks is recursively obtained. Please see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01133) for more details.
